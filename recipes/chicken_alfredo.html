    <h2>Yummy chicken alfredo</h2>
    <p>This is a creamy and indulgent dish of fettuccine pasta tossed with a rich alfredo sauce made with butter, cream,
        and parmesan cheese. It's topped with tender and juicy slices of chicken seasoned with Italian herbs and spices.
        This is a classic Italian-American dish that's easy to make and perfect for a cozy dinner.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces Dry Fettuccine Pasta</li>
        <li>1 pound Skinless Chicken Breasts (boneless)</li>
        <li>1 ¾ teaspoons Italian Seasoning</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Extra-Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Butter</li>
        <li>½ cup Butter (cut into large cubes or slices)</li>
        <li>2 cups Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
        <li>1 clove Garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>2 cups Parmesan Cheese (freshly grated)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the Fettuccine al dente, according to package instructions.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken, then pan-fry in oil and butter, for 6 minutes a side, or until an internal temperature
            reaches 165 degrees F. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for a few minutes, then cut into 1/2-inch
            thick slices. Tent with foil, while you prepare the sauce.</li>
        <li>Using the same pan you used to cook the chicken, the cream, butter, and seasonings are incorporated and
            simmered on medium-low heat until thickened, then the Parmesan is added in until melted and smooth.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta, reserving some of the liquid to loosen the sauce (only if necessary.) Toss immediately with
            the Alfredo sauce. Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of cooked chicken.</li>
    </ol>
