    <p>This is a traditional lasagna recipe layered with a rich meat sauce and a creamy parmesan white sauce, plus the
        perfect amount of mozzarella cheese! No-boil lasagna noodles, layered with a mixture of quality store-bought
        marinara, mixed with ground beef cooked to perfection, ricotta, mozzarella, and a special parmesan mix - all
        garnished with fresh basil on top. It's comfort food at its best!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 no-boil lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound of ground beef</li>
        <li>2 jars of quality store-bought marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup of ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until no longer pink. Drain the fat.</li>
        <li>Add the marinara sauce to the skillet with the beef, stir well, and let it simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the meat sauce is simmering, mix the ricotta cheese, 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese, and the parmesan
            cheese in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Arrange 4 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Spread a third of the cheese mixture over the noodles. Repeat
            these layers twice.</li>
        <li>Top the final layer of noodles with the remaining meat sauce, followed by the remaining mozzarella cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 25 minutes, remove the foil and bake for another 25 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and starting
            to brown.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for 15 minutes before cutting and serving. Garnish with fresh basil.</li>
    </ol>
